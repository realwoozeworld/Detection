# Detection
The task of detecting age and gender, however, is an inherently difficult problem, more so than many other computer vision tasks. The main reason for this difficulty gap lies in the data required to train these types of systems.

While general object detection tasks can often have access to hundreds of thousands or even millions of images for training, datasets with age and/or gender labels are considerably smaller, usually in the thousands or, at best, tens of thousands.

The reason is that to have tags for such images, we need to access the personal information of the subjects in the images. Namely, we would need their date of birth and gender, and in particular date of birth is infrequently published information.

Namely, we would need their date of birth and gender, and in particular date of birth is infrequently published information. Therefore, we have to settle for the nature of this problem that we are addressing and adapt network architectures and algorithmic approaches to deal with these limitations.
